**7:30 PM, Wed Nov 6 at the Fourth Avenue Theatre**, Dordt University. For *free* tickets, go to [www.dordttickets.com](https://dordttickets.universitytickets.com/)

Join us for a narrative staged reading based upon the life of Michael Faraday, the eminent 19th century scientist famous for his groundbreaking in electricity and magnetism. As a devoted Christian and committed experimentalist throughout his life, Faradayâ€™s work raises the question: can physics show us the mind of God?

Performance will be followed by reception and panel discussion.

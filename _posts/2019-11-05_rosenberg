“Between organic and mechanistic views of nature: Creation ex nihilo and Augustine’s reworking of Genesis” a lecture by Stan Rosenberg

Abstract: In his largest commentary on Genesis, de Genesi ad litteram, Augustine decisively set aside the vision of the cosmos that saw all particular phenomena as a result of the particular will of the gods or a God and rejected the enchanted world which dominated Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman cosmologies.The commentary signals a sea change that more thoroughly implemented the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, an understanding of the cosmos that had long been part of Christian thought but not fully fleshed out.  Augustine’s work desacralized and demystified nature, making it into a contingent, objective, rational structure: not simply a form of rudimentary mechanism but also not reducible to a form of organic causation.

Stan Rosenberg, Ph.D., is executive director of Scholarship and Christianity in Oxford (SCIO) and Vice President for Research and Scholarship of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU).
